# Moving forward

Upon completing this tutorial you should know the basics on how to edit and submit your team wiki.  
Below we offer some suggestions on how to take a step further and be more effective in the process.

## MkDocs and Material for MkDocs

We presented some of the most important features for customizing your wiki contents, but you may wish to know that these static site generators allow many more customizations, like changing theme colors and adding emojis.

For more information on the underlying mechanism of [MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org), please check their documentation site.

For information on customizing the theme, please see [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Useful features in Material for MkDocs

In the [mock wiki](https://idec2021.github.io/team-wiki/) for this tutorial, we have a [page](https://idec2021.github.io/team-wiki/useful_features/) demonstrating 3 useful features enabled by default:

- Mathematical equations input by LaTeX
- Sortable Tables
- Markdown footnotes for citations

Be sure to check the [Markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idec2021/team-wiki/main/docs/useful_features.md) behind if your team use Material for MkDocs for your wiki.

## Git and GitHub

Throughout this tutorial we used GitHub Desktop for version control illustration. GitHub Desktop provides an intuitive graphic user interface (GUI) which is great for beginners. You can find a lot of help from the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) of GitHub Desktop and our tutorial is to some extent based on it.

As you move forward, you may find the [command line interface (CLI) version](https://git-scm.com/downloads) more powerful since it permits automation of tasks.
