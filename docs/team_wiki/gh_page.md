### Configuring the URL of the team wiki

(optional function)

## Texts that are meant for idec.io instead

We do not impose any restrictions on what technologies, packages, or languages that team use to generate their wikis. A wiki can be created using traditional HTML, CSS and Javascript, through a static site generator, or a content-management system.

### Restrictions

We only impose the following restrictions on wiki:

- If the default wiki (a styled Material for MkDocs) is not used, teams should include the following banner on all pages of their wiki site. It should also use the iDEC official faivcon. This requirement is demanded to show that the wiki is part of iDEC 2021.
- The GitHub page should be purely static and not relying on communications with a third-party server / database / service provider to render the contents.
- Following the above, all assests, including but not limited to CSS style sheets, javascript files, images and downloadable PDFs, that are displayed on the team wikis should be part of the GitHub repository.
- Raw or processed experiment data should not be part of GitHub repository and should be hosted by appropriate research databases instead.
- It is important to not use


## Static site generator suggestions

If a team does not wish to use the default wiki, they can consider using 

- Material for MkDocs
- Sphinx
- Gatsby
- Gitbook
- Publii
