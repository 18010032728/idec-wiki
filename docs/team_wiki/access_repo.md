# Accessing your wiki repository

You will need permission to write directly into and configure settings in your team wiki repository. To do so, follow the steps below:

1. [Register for a GitHub account](https://github.com/join/) if you do not have one yet
2. Go to [reg.idec.io/accounts/social/connections/](https://reg.idec.io/accounts/social/connections/) and sign in
3. Under **Add a third party account**, click **Sign in with GitHub**
    <!-- Signin -->
4. Authorize the iDEC Team Portal app
5. Check that your GitHub account is now connected to your registered account
6. Go to the **Team** tab
7. Click the green **GitHub** icon button for your team
8. You will be redirected to a new page. 
    Here, check that your team information is correct
9. At the bottom of the page, the system should have detected your connected GitHub username(s)
10. Pick the username you want to add, if you connected multiple GitHub accounts
11. Click on the submit button
12. You should see *green*, success messages if you are successfully invited
13. Check your email (that you registered with GitHub) and look for an invitation to join the repository
14. Accept the invitation
15. You can now manage your wiki repository with **[maintain](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#repository-access-for-each-permission-level)** permission
