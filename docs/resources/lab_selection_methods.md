# Laboratory selection methods

Clever selection schemes empower directed evolution. And as many functionalities and objectives there are as many there are selection protocols. We aimed to give you an overview of the most basic ones. For simplicity we focused our review largely on molecular directed evolution approaches and divided the selection schemes into two large classes: 

- [Selection of binders](binders.md)
- [Selection of enzymes and reporters](enzymes.md)
